# Tips to set-up python working on my mac

# Python CONDA environments

1) To activate the base environment type : $ conda activate   =====> NOT WORKING ???
-Instead : $source /anaconda3/bin/activate  ===> WORKS..
-to exit the environment type: $ conda deactivate
Note: you will not want to work in the base environment ; instead, you will want to create a clone environment to work in, 
in particular to install specific packages/softwares (in case the install would turn wrong, you can simply delete the environment 
and you base python will not be affected

2)
